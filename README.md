# Calculator

Calculator is a program that allows the user to input two integers and decide whether multiply, divide, add, or subtract them.

## How it works

After you've have copy and pasted the code in your IDE, run the program to begin. The program will prompt you with a question
enter your name, then enter two whole numbers and the program will ask you to chose an option between 1 - 4  (multiply, divide,
add, or subtract). The program will give you the result and you are good to close the program if you want to try again.
